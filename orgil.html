        <p>
          Hey, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express myself
          because I can’t do it through words.
          <br />
          <br />
          The purpose of this letter is to express myself, so for a little
          background information, since I was a kid I wasn’t able to share my
          feelings or emotions with others, I don’t when it started but it was
          always there with me that side of me. So that resulted in holding my
          emotions to myself and pent them up to myself. Now it has become
          almost a habit for me, well it does have some pros and cons, for pros
          I think it has given me some degree of patience to hold myself and to
          be calm in potentially stressful moments, overall helped me to be more
          rational in any given moment also helped me to be aware of others
          feelings, for cons, I think it made more dull person, not sharing my
          feelings or my thoughts to anything, for me doing that was
          meaningless, felt like an argument would arise, so for me avoiding to
          share my feelings was to protect my peacefulness. Now to think about
          it not sharing my feelings with others has made me more rational, and
          I think about others' perspectives.
          <br />
          <br />
          But over time it did have some negative effects on me, I have become a
          lonely person who thinks no one will understand me, even if I shared
          myself I would get this feeling that I overshared, which kind of made
          me feel guilty that I should I always keep it within myself. I’ve
          never fully shared my feelings with others, just partially, so the
          purpose of this letter was to let you know that I’m a troublesome
          person, but I have decided to open myself to you bit by bit. I also
          want to mention that it seems that I have some degree of anxiety, it
          seems that I live in the future. Since the 11th grade, I built up this
          version of myself, a self who is a scientist or an intelligent person,
          and I realized I needed to study hard, I had concluded that to become
          that person I had a limited time, so I decided to divide my free time
          to 3 sections for study, for friends, for family. In conclusion, I
          chose not to have a girlfriend, at that time I thought it was a waste
          of time, but I did try to have friends with benefits(in these you guys
          call it situationship in my days it was friends with benefits), now
          I’ve realized that I’m just a hollow person. Of course, I tried to
          have a girlfriend, I would think to myself she could be my girlfriend,
          but no matter how much I tried I wasn’t able to open myself to others,
          because of this they would just ghost me, or lose interest in me. So
          for a while, I lost interest in relationships or any kind of
          connection. It was just me. Also, I did try to find peace by myself, I
          tried new things, and I developed new hobbies to occupy myself, at
          first it was working in the beginning, but later I would get bored of
          it. I knew deep down in myself, that I was lonely, I needed some
          attention. I also knew it was kind of impossible in my current
          situation.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I mentioned, I built up a character in my mind when I was in 11th
          grade, that character was a scientist, someone who is highly
          intelligent, or a person who is capable of talking basic or
          entry-level of any science field. So I thought I had to work hard, I
          did work hard but I burnt up many times, and I understood reasons or
          causes through therapy, main reason was If I wasn’t productive or
          learned something new, I felt this sense of guilt that I wasted a
          whole day, because of this, I felt that I wouldn’t be able to go
          forward to my future, I will just stop on the same spot, to me to
          reach something you have go forward little by little, so for me
          stopping like this was no for me. Because of this, I was living in a
          future, that caused a lot of stress, anxiety, and anger. Now I’m not
          gonna say I got better, I got just aware of what kind of things are
          causing me problems. Even though I knew things that were causing me
          problems, I couldn’t do anything. As days went by I got worse, felt
          like I was falling through a hole. If try to write it how it is worse,
          or try to get out of the hole, It will be a long story. So I want to
          talk it out with you in the future. In conclusion In the end, for me,
          it feels like deep down in myself there is a boy who never fully
          opened up or understood. So I ask you to accept me as is and help that
          boy to find his peace.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for your time and consideration. Again I’m asking you to
          make us official. Sincerely, Orgil
